## The problem
nowadays many are sensitive to electromagnetic frequency radiation mainly due to excessive exposure above natural and healthy limits. There are many solutions to mitigate exposure to this kind of radiation however none have the ability to collect EMF energy values directly from a window or access door to a balcony.

## The idea
This smart device is intended to be installed and fixed into a copper electromagnetic (EM) shield on any EM indoor window or balcony door. It has the main ability to collect EM sensor data from the curtain itself and send it to a public data repository, for instance, a #dataverse (see www.dataverse.org)

<br>

The smart safety & health solution is for the kind of wireless aggression that behaves like ripples in a pond. For instance Wireless electromagnetic radios, including those found on smartphones, tablets, wifi routers at home, and many more.

**This smart device is not able to detect wireless aggressions targeted to a person's body and individual. For instance, using some kind of beam-forming device or technologies**. For example, Laser and laser-like kind of devices and kind of technologies. 

**When installing this smart solution, take action and be conscious that the aggression/aggressor may change to other types and kinds of "wireless devices" this smart device is unable to detect**.  

**Always use this smart device connected to a public data repository with LIVE data streams. At the same time, notify the authorities immediately and provide the web address link where the public data repository can be found**. Data repositories based on Harvard's www.dataverse.org are currently the most suited (not ideal) for the smart solution provided. 

**Be advised**


Known open data repositories partially compatible with these smart devices:
- www.dataverse.org [partial compatible] (open firmware provided here uses a dataverse repository API)
- www.figshare.com [partial compatible]
- www.datadryad.org [not compatible; no API]

This device is designed to burn out every time an electromagnetic pulse, spark, or other EMF has a too-high energy. This way the victim can use the burnt device as evidence when presenting a complaint to the authorities.

stay safe.

### ![](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-WIFI-BLE-RFID-NFC-Desk-Contacless-Reader-Writer/blob/main/designs/working_green.png) Status
  Hardware electronics are Fully tested and working. The first ü•á release of the firmware code is now available.
  
  <p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/media/testing_phase_alpha.jpg" height="300">

</p>

[January 1, 2024] - The firmware 1.0.0 for Over the Air Updates is now released to the public. Goto the [releases section](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Aeonlabs-Home-Automation-Smart-EMF-Shield-Curtain-for-Windows-and-Balconies/releases/tag/openFirmware) to learn more.  

<br>

## OEM Firmware code
The OEM version of the firmware code can be found in the folder **OEM firmware code**.  It has by default OTA updates, meaning the smart concrete curing device automatically updates it self when newer updated versions are made available here.  

This code uses my own ESP32 C++ class libraries to expedite the development of the code of ESP32 microcontrollers. The repository is located in the [open source software section](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-ESP32-C-Base-Firmware-Libraries#readme).

#### Send the collected sensor data to this repository
On this repository, there's a special folder, named [datasets](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Safety-Health/tree/main/Measurements/datasets), where anyone is able to upload dataset files directly from their open smart devices. This folder is intended to facilitate sharing of "electromagnetic" measurements among anyone with interest and capable of studying and analyzing it in search of EM anomalies to improve detection of the open hardware electronics made available here. **Anyone is invited to participate, cost-free**. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; To assist you with the firmware programming, there's a C++ test code compatible with all Arduino devices that anyone can use to speed up the programming of the open smart device. Here's the link: <br>
https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Aeonlabs-Arduino_Hardware_Test_Code/tree/main/github_api_test_upload <br>
Any questions on how to do it, send me a message on the Discord Server:
